### Background

<p align="left">
  "Welcome to the game. You will have to make choices or something." These 12 words, shown everytime you boot into a new chapter of Banana Fork, show you just how much of a treat you are in for. With crazy plots and characters, an overarching secret storyline, and a main character that can't seem to keep themselves out of trouble, Banana Fork is truly a text-based treat, and with the updates made in the Remastered version, the games are better than ever. Happy playing!
